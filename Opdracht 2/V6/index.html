        <h1>FKA twigs</h1>
        <p>
          This is a school assignment for Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA).
          The assignment was to create a full visual identity for a musical artist.
          In my case the artist is FKA twigs, and I designed a visual identity for her
          potential new album. The concept is based on the dance style called Vogue which
          FKA twigs often uses in her videoclips, performances and fotoshoots. This is a
          dance style that involves elegant and fluent hand movements. I used outlines of
          FKA twigsâ€™ own hands, traced from photos of her. Inside of these outlines I have
          used photomanipulation to implement my own photographs of stylized black and white hands.

        <h1>Awoke</h1>
        <p>
          Awoke is both a traditional and a web based magazine which purpose is
          to promote an alternative view on pop culture. The magazine expresses
          interesting opinions on lifestyle, fashion, music and art. The branding
          creates a mix of classical and modern elements to form a contemporary yet
          stylish identity.

        <p>
          Crudo is a hip, fresh and new raw food restaurant located in Nijmegen,
          The Netherlands. I designed their corporate branding, logo, website and
          print while working for 'Byron Reclamebureau'. The overal objective of
          the design is to be appetizing and represent the freshness of the products
          from the restaurant. The webdesign is designed around a 'one-page' principle.
